        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Tina. I've been playing rhythm games of all kinds for some
          years. I actively play <em>beatmania IIDX</em>, but I also play a lot
          of others, namely <em>SOUND VOLTEX</em>, <em>Dance Dance
          Revolution</em>, <em>Pump It Up</em>, <em>NotITG</em>, <em>pop'n
          music</em>, <em>Project Diva</em>, <em>Taiko no Tatsujin</em>, and the
          list goes on...
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>osu!</em> was the first rhythm game I played actively. I was
          launching the game frequently, trying to improve myself, and trying to
          climb in the leaderboard. At some point, it made me aware of other
          existing rhythm games, and I started investing time and money in them
          instead of <em>osu!</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still like <em>osu!</em> a lot, it certainly made something
          interesting out of <em>Ouendan</em>'s gameplay. <em>mania</em> also
          opened a lot of persons to traditional rhythm games.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are a lot of things that feel wrong to me in
          <em>osu!</em>, and I want to fix them. With <strong>Osmosis</strong>,
          I'm trying to fix all the things I don't like about <em>osu!</em> in
          the form of an alternative ranking system.
        </p>

        <h2>What is wrong with <em>osu!</em>?</h2>
        <p>
          The scoring system in standard is super wrong. The combo weights all
          of the score. Even though combo rewards consistency of players, rhythm
          games are about playing a song correctly. This can mostly be judged by
          the ability of the player to keep a given accuracy no matter the
          difficulty of the patterns to execute.<br>
          Different ways to reward consistency can be to give a bonus if the
          players fullcombo some parts. This is can be seen in <em>Project
          Diva</em> for example. In <em>osu!</em>, that would be fullcombo-ing
          Kiai parts. Another way would be to give a bonus at the end depending
          on the max combo obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ranked beatmaps is an hell of copyright infrigement. Rhythm games
          elegantly ties together the art of making games and making music. Both
          parties have to be respected for a rhythm game to grow peacefully in
          the ecosystem. Balantly infringing copyright will only makes you lose
          esteem from composers and makes music licensing companies able to sue
          you. Respecting artists rights actually usually encourages more
          artists to get interested in your game, opening more opportunities for
          new legitimate original content.

          The pp system sucks and Score V2 isn't going to fix it.

      <section>
        <h2>How could <strong>Project Osmosis</strong> fix that?</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine a leaderboard where scores and pp are based on your accuracy
          and only legitimate songs are considered for being added to the ranked
          pool. Welcome to <strong>Project Osmosis</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Score is purely based on accuracy. pp are given depending on your
          accuracy on a set amount of highest scores. Beatmaps are carefully
          reviewed before being added to the ranking pool and can only be added
          if using them is authorized by their authors. Songs from <em>osu!</em>
          featured artists take priority.
